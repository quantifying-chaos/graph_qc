# Python Scripts for Graphing for the report Quantifying Chaos

This project uses the tool `uv` and `src` directory tree for package managements.

## Structure of the Project

```

└── uv.lock
```

All scripts are in the `src` directory. 
Yet `uv` will also generate some temporary files named `...egg-info` and `__pycache__`, which shall be ignored.

Each figure produced in the report is generated by the code in each subdirectory in `src`. 
To run the code, go the the subdirectory and run command

```
uv run main.py
```

which will generated the figure in the same directory.
In Wayland environment, you may need to set the environment variable 
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` before running the command.

The `utils.py` file contains the utility functions.
Use `utils.py` in any of the subpackages by

```python 
import utils 

utils. 
```

If a function `helper()` is contained in a file `util` contained subpackage named `subpkg`, that is 

```
├── src
│   ├── subpkg
│   │   └── util.py  # containing helper()
```


it can be imported by

```python
from subpkg.util import helper()
```
