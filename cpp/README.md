# More efficien algorithm for for numerics 

Python becomes slow and problematic. 
So we use C++. 
(I would also like to try Rust, but, as C++ is the more stable and traditional language for high performance computation, the usage of Rust is to be deferred). 

There are several resources pertinent to our project.

Multidimensioal Root Finding, see chapter 38 of [gls](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/latex/gsl-ref.pdf#chapter.38).

Arbitrary precision arithmetic, check [gmp](https://gmplib.org/gmp-man-6.3.0.pdf)
